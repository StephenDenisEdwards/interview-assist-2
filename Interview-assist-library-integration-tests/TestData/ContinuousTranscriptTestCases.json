Can you store different types in an array in C sharp. And the answer is yes, if you create an object array. Let's understand that with an example. Here I have a console application. Now let's create an integer array. Now look at this. I can store an integer within this array, because that is an integer array. If I try to store a string, look at what is going to happen. We will get a compilation error. Look at that. We have an error cannot implicitly convert type string to int. So arrays are strongly typed. You can only store integer type within this array. But then if you want to store different data types, create an array of type object. Then look at this. I am able to store an integer. I am able to store a string.
