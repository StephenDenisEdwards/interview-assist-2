And I suspect if the Democrats copies of all of these. And I suspect if the Democrats gain control of the house, copies of all of these. And I suspect if the Democrats gain control of the house, that in 2027, they\u0027re going that in 2027, they\u0027re going to subpoena that in 2027, they\u0027re going to subpoena the estate that in 2027, they\u0027re going to subpoena the estate that in 2027, they\u0027re going to subpoena the estate for the records.

And then we would have a much better chance of finding out, is there photographic chance of finding out, is there photographic evidence? The chance of finding out, is there photographic evidence that Donald Trump is a repeat child child rapist? Or in fact, is he being wrong child rapist? Or in fact, is he being wrongly accused of child rapist? Or in fact, is he being wrongly accused and mistreated? And if he\u0027s being And if he\u0027s being wrongly accused, the And if he\u0027s being wrongly accused, the obvious question to ask is, And if he\u0027s being wrongly accused, the obvious question to ask is why are you not releasing all And if he\u0027s being wrongly accused, the obvious question to ask is why are you not releasing all the files if you have no risk here? the files if you have no risk here? the files if you have no risk here?

How do you think Trump and his White House will respond to this going forward? We seen that when Trump is seen that when Trump is really in hot water, seen that when Trump is really in hot water, he throws out some seen that when Trump is really in hot water, he throws out something else as a seen that when Trump is really in hot water, he throws out something else as a distract seen that when Trump is really in hot water, he throws out something else as a distract So I wonder if you think that he So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran. So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran or, you So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran or, you know, provide more aid to So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran or, you know, provide more aid to Ukraine out of no So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran or, you know, provide more aid to Ukraine out of nowhere just to kind of So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran or, you know, provide more aid to Ukraine out of nowhere just So I wonder if you think that he might strike Iran or, you know, provide more aid to Ukraine out of nowhere just to kind of get the heat off him. Yeah. Don\u0027t don\u0027t Yeah. Donald, when Yeah. Donald, when cornered, is Yeah. Donald, when cornered, is very feral, and he Yeah. Donald, when cornered, is very feral, and he\u0027s in Yeah. Donald, when cornered, is very feral, and he\u0027s in feral mode mode right now. feral mode mode right now, mostly because feral mode mode right now, mostly because of the killing of the two citizens killing of the two citizens in Minneapolis. So killing of the two citizens in Minneapolis. There have been three murders this killing of the two citizens in Minneapolis. There have been three murders this year in Minneapolis two of them by killing of the two citizens in Minneapolis. There have been three murders this year in Minneapolis two of them by Donald Trump\u0027s killing of the two citizens in Minneapolis.

And so he his interest will be in marginal little his interest will be in marginal little references to the his interest will be in marginal little references to the Epstein files and then doing something and then doing something big to have everybody and then doing something big to have everybody concentrate on it and then doing something big to have everybody concentrate on it, and then doing something big to have everybody concentrate on it and ignore the other things that are going and ignore the other things that are going on. So we\u0027re gonna see and ignore the other things that are going on. So we\u0027re gonna see more distractions and ignore the other things that are going on. So we\u0027re gonna see more distractions more of his bellicosity more of his bellicosity even though he ran for more of his bellicosity even though he ran for office saying no more more of his bellicosity even though he ran for office saying no more foreign wars, more of his bellicosity even though he ran for office saying no more foreign wars, but he\u0027s proposing all over the place but he\u0027s proposing all over the place invasions and but he\u0027s proposing all over the place invasions and seizures and but he\u0027s proposing all over the place invasions and seizures and taking over other taking over other people, other taking over other people, other nations, some taking over other people, other nations, sovereignty.
